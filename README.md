# gopherball

Sports game for experimenting with [engo](https://github.com/EngoEngine/engo)

 * gopherball began life as engo's Pong demo.
 * Step 1 was to add goals, gophers, horizontal movement.

Note: engo itself seems pretty fluxy right now - breakages expected. Current engo hash is 4d561ac.

Vague plans:

 * Viewport for bigger pitch. Multiple gophers per team
 * AI for 1-player vs CPU
 * Isometric view (2.5D). Sprites.
 * Weapons, violence, powerups
 * 3D-ish physics (ball traveling in arc).
 * online multiplayer
